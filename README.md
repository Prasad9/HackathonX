In this modern competitive online market, we are solving a problem where a seller exploits certain loopholes in order to have an unfair advantage over his competitors. The seller creates duplicate listings of the product by slightly altering product attributes such as description, sizes and image sequencing to increase its visibility for more sales. This problem can be found across many products on Flipkart website. Such spam-sellers leads to poor user experience for both the buyers and the fellow sellers. Eventually, this can hamper the overall Flipkart business.
